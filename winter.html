                <p>Myanmar is one of the most spectacular travel destination for winter sun in Asia.
                    The big part of the country offer sun-soaked tourist attractions with perfect tropical weather which
                    is hot during the day and cool in the evening.
                    Winter is a wonderful time to explore the majestic temples, extraordinary landscapes of Myanmar and
                    undoubtedly, plunge into the amazing beaches. It is not all,
                    there are still high mountains in our country which provides mild weather like in Europe where you
                    can enjoy unlike trekking or other adventures. </p>

                <h4 class="text-center">Trip</h4>
                <p>The most comfortable time of year to visit Myanmar is the winter season.
                    Average temperatures from November to February remain around 70-75°F (21-24°C) during the day
                    depending on the region.
                    The most popular destinations get quite crowded for this very reason though. Exploring Myanmar
                    when it isn’t scorching hot or all soggy and wet makes winter the prime traveling time.
                    The winter time in Myanmar starts from Mid October and finishes in February.
                    The temperature during the day time is about 30 degree Celcius and drops to about 20 degree in the
                    evening.

                <p>The Inle Lake fishermen belong to the Intha people, who are the main tribe that lives around Inle

                    fishing, farming, and sometimes crafting souvenirs to sell to tourists.
                    They live in the huts on stilts that you'll see all around the shores of the lake, and farm the
                    ‘floating gardens’, vegetable beds made from woven reeds and pegged to the lakebed with stakes.

                    The best time to visit <b>Pyin Oo Lwin</b> is during the strawberry season in December and the
                    flower festival during New Year's Eve.
                    Besides, the Hot Air Balloon Festival takes place in mid-November.

                    of year.

                    Sweater knitting, flower and vegetable gardens, strawberry and pineapple orchards, coffee

                    The peaceful Pyin Oo Lwin is a picture perfect town with pretty little houses, blocks and roads with
                    little traffic.
                    Many houses that used to be a resort for British officials and soldiers coming to Myanmar still
                    retain the English style of architecture.
                    Crossing the main road Lashio is the symbol of Pyin Oo Lwin - the clock tower named Purcell Tower,
                    built in the style of Big Ben Tower in London.

                    Lashio) makes for one of Myanmar’s most fascinating journeys,

                    The beautiful blue lake lagoon is located in Taw Kyal Village, Ywar Ngan Township.
                    The blue lagoon appears that groundwater emerges and flows down a stream into the lake,
                    which is the reason the water is transparent.
                    Locals from the village believed that the lake is a sacred lake and home to spirits
                    and a spiky wire fence keeps visitors from entering the lake.
                    Villagers believed that the guardian spirit can cause trouble for those who show disrespect to the
                    lake,
                    therefore, the main reason to build the fence around the lake. Disrespectful behavior such as
